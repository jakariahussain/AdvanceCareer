                            <p>The University of Manchester from Bangladesh is one of the most sought-after destinations
                                for higher education. If you are serious about studying at the University of Manchester
                                from Bangladesh, you have to find various facts. Many students want to study in the UK,
                                and their first choice is the University of Manchester. The University of Manchester is
                                ranked 27th worldwide in the QS world university ranking of 2021. For instance,
                                Bangladesh is one of Asia's leading places, from where the student acceptance rate at
                                the University of Manchester is pretty high and has earned a lot of reputation
                                worldwide. This is why a large number of students prefer to study in the UK as per the
                                availability of courses as well as due to the affordable tuition fees.</p>
                            <p>As far as the study is concerned, this country offers numerous opportunities to the
                                students who are willing to complete their education with good knowledge. The cost of
                                education is not much high as compared to other European countries or American
                                universities. It is a very affordable cost compared to the cost of studying at the
                                University of America or the European countries. It is also quite reasonable when
                                compared to the cost of traveling to that country to explore.</p>
                            <p>When you opt for the University of Manchester from Bangladesh, you should know that
                                International Education Counselling Centre, IECC, is the official partner of this
                                institution in Bangladesh. This means you can choose to start your studies at any time

                                have the Best UK-based counseling team in Bangladesh. On top of that, we provide an
